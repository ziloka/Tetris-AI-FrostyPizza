# Tetris-AI
I'm working on a Tetris AI. I started this about a year ago, gave up, and then started again, so some of the code is awful and some is a little better.

# Development

# Requirements
- Install vcpkg in a directory (msft recommends C:\src\vcpkg)

To install dependencies 
run in that directory
```
.\vcpkg.exe install sfml
```

make sure you run 
```
.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
```

before clicking on the *.sln project
